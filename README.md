This is the home for the development of Galaga AI. We all know and love the original 1981 space shooter game created by Namco. However, this version of Galaga takes a spin of removing the patterns and letting the aliens train to find and attack the player.

This project was made for the CS-4430 Machine Learning and Intelligent Agents course at Cedarville University.
